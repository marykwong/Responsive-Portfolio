                Hello world! My name is Mary Kwong. I currently work for a Federal agency as a Legal Administrative Specialist. 
                I graduated from UC Davis in 2014 with Bachelors degrees in Statistics and Managerial Economics. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I am a participant of the 2019 UC Berkeley Extension Coding Bootcamp. I am interested in working with data and software. 
                I love math and I find coding really fun. I have prior experience coding in R, mySQL, Html/Css. 
                <br>
                <br>
                When I'm not coding/working, I like to travel, go on hikes, eat good food, and sleep. I try to travel internationally at least once
                a year and go on weekend excursions to different cities about every other month. I travel mostly for food, nature, and concerts (I'm a huge fan of live music/music festivals!). 
                <br>
                <br>
                I am actively seeking employment in the San Francisco Bay Area.
